statistical analysis code

## Description
This repository is for STATA code written by Larisa Tereshchenko for statistical analysis of the data. I provide this code in the spirit of openness, to enable replication of my analyses. The details of used data, and full description of statistical methods are provided in the manuscripts. 
Disclaimer: I use the standard STATA code. I use STATA code that was developed by the STATA statisticians and contributors and that I learned from various STATA training, classes, blogs, webinars, books, journals, etc. (which are, by the way, awesome!). I provide all citations on sources and methods in my manuscripts. This repository is a technical repository of STATA code. I do not claim an invention of the code. I also do not accept grievances from other investigators who may use the same code. Once again, this is a standard STATA code. See my manuscripts for citations and references.
